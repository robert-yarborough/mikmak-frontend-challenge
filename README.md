## Carousel Image Gallery

This carousel will be built using a higher order function named Slider, to be used as the base for all other child elements.
The child elements are basically one “Slide” component, that just switches out the urls of the images,
instead of creating unnecessary amounts of redundant “Slide” components. Which aren't declarative.
To create the illusion of image shifting to next image, an index property will be set to 0 in the state object of Slider Component.
This is how the images get tracked, and how it's none which of the images to display to user.


##How to Reproduce Project
1. cd into carousel directory
2. npm install
3. npm run start



## Jest / Snapshot Testing Components
